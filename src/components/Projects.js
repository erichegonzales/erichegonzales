              AllThingSurf is a social media application for the surfing
              community to connect by sharing content, lessons, and news. Users
              can create posts and utilize their feed to establish their
              personal brand or keep up with other surfers in the community.
              Users will also register as coaches to create lessons that surfers
              can request to book.
              {/* Two challenges I observed when I learned to surf
                was: 1. How can I meet other surfers in my community? 2. How do
                I find a reputable coach and receive personalized lessons? The
                app aims to solve these issues by featuring a feed that shows
                the content of surfers in a preferred location, of popular
                surfers, or of any surfer they choose to follow. Surfers can
                register and create a coach profile, specify their
                qualifications, and post lessons. Any surfer can request to book
                these lessons. The content-sharing serves as a way for users to
                interact with surfers in their community and for coaches to
                establish their personal brand and reputation. */}
